Hi there!

My name is Thomas Neitmann. I am an `R` enthusiast currently working for Swiss pharmaceutical company [Roche](https://www.roche.com/) as a Statistical Programmer Analyst for late-phase clinical trials in neuroscience indications.

My `R` journey began in 2014 when a coworker told me to run an `R` script to "analyze some data". Having never programmed before at that time I was overwhelmed. But I took on the challenge and soon realized the power and joy of programming.

Since then I learned a couple of other programming languages including `MATLAB`, `Python` and `SAS`. But my favorite is still by far `R`.

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and started doing so publicly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasneitmann/) in late 2019. Since then I went from around 300 to 7000+ followers. Many of those encouraged me to create a blog to have a central place for all my posts. So that's what I did.

As the name suggests this blog focuses predominantly on `R`. I will occasionally cover other, related topics such as `git`, though. I also enjoy data visualization a lot so you'll likely find some posts on that, too.

If you have a specific topic you would like me to write about please feel free to reach out. The best option to do so is via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasneitmann/). If you are not yet connected with me, make sure to send me a request. Looking forward to having you join my network!

Finally, if you don't enjoy reading that much but would like to *watch* me code you can do so on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdJ5y9mqgXLeGzxP7u1C8nA). See you there!
